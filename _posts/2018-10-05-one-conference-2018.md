This year was the first time I visited the One Conference. During the event, I went to some technical talks and had fun with a lot of people. But at the beginning of the event Minister of Justice and Security [Ferd Grapperhaus](https://twitter.com/ferdgrapperhaus) considered arresting the 50 hackers at The One Conference. But it was a [joke](https://twitter.com/LousewiesvdLaan/status/1047031198546087936), he doesn't realize that we are on his side. 

One of the 2 reasons I went to the One Conference was because of the Hackers Handshake exhibition which I was a part of. And because I am also part of the [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)'s](https://www.ncsc.nl/) new [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure]({{site.url}}/assets/docs/cvd-en.pdf) guidelines - see page 1 and 20 ;).

I also took a [picture](https://twitter.com/ptrczrk/status/1047064027992612865)  with [Patricia Zorko](https://twitter.com/ptrczrk) Director Cyber Security and Deputy National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV).
